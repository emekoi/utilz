<h1 align="center">utilz</h1>

i started using linux a while back and ricing seemed kinda cool, so i wanted to try writing some utils for ricing in zig. i might also add any other unix/linux utilities and little zig libraries i write later on. one of my goals is to use libc as little as possible.

## utilities
- [pal](pal/README.md)

## libraries
- [build_sys](build/README.md)
- [crummy](crummy/README.md)
- [stb](stb/README.md)
